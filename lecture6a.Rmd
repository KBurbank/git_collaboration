# Collaborating in git

To set up collaboration, everybody needs to get the same repository on their computer.  Then, the workflow goes like this:

1. pull
2. do work
3. commit
4. repeat steps 2-3 until at a good stopping place
5. pull again
6. resolve any conflicts
7. push

# Conflicts

You are working on a file called planets.md. There is a line that you have modified, but it's also been modified by somebody else recently!  It looks like this:

Your file:
```
blah blah blah blah.
doopy doo.

the number of planets are nine.

yup, that's how many planets there are.
```

Their file, that they committed:

```
blah blah blah blah.
doopy doo.

the number of planets are eight.

yup, that's how many planets there are.
```

After you commit your changes, and then pull, you will get an error that looks like this:

```
git status
# # On branch branch-b
# # You have unmerged paths.
# #   (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
# #
# # Unmerged paths:
# #   (use "git add ..." to mark resolution)
# #
# # both modified:      planets.md
# #
# no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

If you open up planets.md on your computer, you now see something like:

```
blah blah blah blah.
doopy doo.


the number of planets are
<<<<<<< HEAD
nine
=======
eight
>>>>>>> master

yup, that's how many planets there are.
```

You said there were nine planets, the other person said there were eight. (Who is right???)

So you just edit the file as normal, removing all the <<<< business and picking the version that you like. It might be what you had, or what they had, or something in between:

```
blah blah blah blah.
doopy doo.


the number of planets are in dispute; some say there are eight, some say there are nine. It depends whether we count Pluto.

yup, that's how many planets there are.
```

Stage this and commit and now push. 

When your collaborator gets to work, she starts by pulling. Your change will come through to her!
